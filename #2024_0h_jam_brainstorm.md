## What do we want to get out of this?
- a structured file for recording descisions
	
	yaml with web GUI
	
	IE, for a pixel art game:
		base canvas size, setting in godot, 
		size of sprites
		base animation frame rate
		5 seconds for character to walk across the screen
		
- a script that can execute on the recorded descisions

	will apply values to engine settings and node settings
	it can create scenes and configure it's nodes using values from a yaml config
				
- a structured method for making a demo in a few hours

## What can we do in 1 hour?

- lean into the engine
- things that can hurt eachother and die
- interaction that counts points
- timer

## Game Ideas

- be on top of the environemntal requirements
  -  temp
